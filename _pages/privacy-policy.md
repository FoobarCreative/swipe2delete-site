_Foobar Creative_ is committed to providing you with the best possible customer service experience. _Foobar Creative_ is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Australia), which sets out a number of principles concerning the privacy of individuals.

### Collection of your personal information

Swipe2delete does not collect personal information when viewing our website. Within the iOS app, non-personally identifiable data such as device locale, app version, operating system, and crash logs are collected to improve performance and troubleshoot issues. If you contact us via email, we will store your email address.

The app may also utilize third-party tools, such as Google Analytics and Facebook SDK, to monitor app performance and usage patterns.

### Sharing of your personal information

We may employ other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as customer support or transaction processing. These companies will only have access to the personal information required to perform their services. Foobar Creative ensures these organizations comply with confidentiality and privacy obligations when handling your information.

### Use of your personal information

The non-personally identifiable information collected is used internally for performance monitoring, bug fixes, and app improvements. This includes user locale, app version, operating system, and crash data.

Any updates to our data collection practices will only apply to information collected after the policy change.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Foobar Creative reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any significant changes will be reflected here. If you disagree with the Privacy Policy, please refrain from using the app or site.

### Accessing Your Personal Information

You have a right to access your personal information, subject to exceptions allowed by law. If you would like to do so, please let us know. You may be required to put your request in writing for security reasons. _Foobar Creative_ reserves the right to charge a fee for searching for, and providing access to, your information on a per request basis.
